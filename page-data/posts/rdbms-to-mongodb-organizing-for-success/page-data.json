As a result, MongoDB offers out-of-the-box scale-out and data localization with automatic sharding, and replica sets to maintain always-on availability. Business logic is distributed across Client Applications and eliminates centralized need for Stored Procedures in the backend system. Saying that, special skilled resources on SQL based environment is not required any more and the same can be covered by the Application developers who are more close to the business.

Development is simplified as MongoDB documents map naturally to modern, object-oriented programming languages. Using MongoDB removes the complex object-relational mapping (ORM) layer that translates objects in code to relational tables. MongoDB’s flexible data model also means that your database schema can evolve with business requirements</p>\n<p>As organizations are more on building their infrastructure over cloud the fact, MongoDB is built for the cloud. Its native scale-out architecture, enabled by ‘<strong>sharding</strong>,’ aligns well with the horizontal scaling and agility afforded by cloud computing. MongoDB can also be scaled within and across multiple distributed data centers, providing new levels of availability and scalability which is previously unachievable with relational databases. As your deployments grow in terms of data volume and throughput, MongoDB scales easily with no downtime, and without changing your application. In contrast, to achieve scale with relational databases often requires significant, custom engineering work</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-developer-choose-mongodb\"><a href=\"#why-developer-choose-mongodb\" aria-label=\"why developer choose mongodb permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why developer choose MongoDB</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>From Rigid Tables to Flexible and Dynamic BSON Documents</li>\n<li>Documents represent data in the same way that applications do. This makes it much simpler and faster for developers to model how data in the application will map to data stored in the database</li>\n<li>Documents make applications fast - with data for an entity stored in a single document, rather than spread across multiple relational tables, the database only needs to read and write to a single place.

But the way we build and run applications today, coupled with unrelenting growth in new data sources and user loads are pushing relational databases beyond their limits. This can inhibit business agility, limit scalability, and strain budgets, compelling more and more organizations to migrate to alternatives. The RDBMS optimizes data storage efficiency (as it was conceived at a time when storage was the most expensive component of the system. But the MongoDB’s document model is optimized for how the application accesses data (as performance, developer time, and speed to market are now more important than storage volumes)</p>\n<p>The Schema evaluation and impact on Schema design - In the world of SQL, the developers and DBA working on a new development project using a RDBMS must first start specifying the database schema before the code is written. MongoDB enables developers evolve the schema through an iterative and agile nature</p>\n<p>The out of the box benefit of NoSQL database over RDBMS is the full text search feature. MongoDB provides a specialized index for text search that uses advanced, language-specific linguistic rules for stemming, tokenization and stop words. Queries that use the text search index return documents in relevance order. Each collection may have at most one text index but it may include multiple fields</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-over-other-nosql-databases\"><a href=\"#benefits-over-other-nosql-databases\" aria-label=\"benefits over other nosql databases permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Benefits over other NoSQL Databases</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi ACID transactions supported from 4.0 which is unique from other NoSQL databases</li>\n<li>The Aggregation framework is extensive to match almost all the SQL features which not most of the NoSQL gives</li>\n<li>Native, idiomatic drivers are provided for 10+ languages – and the community has built dozen</li>\n<li>BI connectors - MongoDB can be easily explored with industry-standard SQL-based BI and analytics platforms</li>\n<li>MongoDB Charts is a new tool that enables you to quickly and easily create and share visualizations of your MongoDB data</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"considerations-when-migrating-from-rdbms-to-mongodb\"><a href=\"#considerations-when-migrating-from-rdbms-to-mongodb\" aria-label=\"considerations when migrating from rdbms to mongodb permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Considerations when migrating from RDBMS to MongoDB</h2>\n<p>Importance of <strong>de-normalizing data</strong> - as the collections are normalized the number of joins when you query increases. One biggest benefit of MongDB over RDBMS is less number of reads from the disk/store. Means, reducing number of relational joins reduces the no of reads to the physical store exponentially and which intern provides a high performance</p>\n<p>In other side, there are examples where <strong>normalizing data</strong> can be beneficial, especially when data from multiple sources needs to be blended for analysis – this can be done using the $lookup</p>\n<p><strong>Schema modeling considerations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applications data access pattern</li>\n<li>Life-cycle of data</li>\n<li>Growth rate of documents</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Embedding vs Referencing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Embedding used in 1:1 or 1:m relationship where many objects always used in the context of the parent document, or the other way there is not much relevance for the child document if the parent is deleted</li>\n<li>Referencing is more of normalization m:1 or m:m relationships, if the objects are referenced from different sources</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Indexes</strong> in MongoDB largely correspond to indexes in a relational database. MongoDB uses B-Tree indexes, and natively supports secondary indexes. As such, it will be immediately familiar to those coming from a SQL background</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-more-mongodb-offers\"><a href=\"#what-more-mongodb-offers\" aria-label=\"what more mongodb offers permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What more MongoDB offers</h2>\n<p>Other than what is been discussed above, MongoDB as an enterprise offers lot of services and offerings which an organization or an individual can get benefited.
